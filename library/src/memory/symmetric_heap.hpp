 *
 * @brief Contains a symmetric heap
 *
 * Every processing element allocates a symmetric heap. (For details on
 * the symmetric heap, refer to the OpenSHMEM specification.)
 *
 * The symmetric heap is allocated using fine-grained memory to allow
 * both host access and device access to the memory space.
 *
 * The symmetric heaps are visible to network by registering them as
 * InfiniBand memory regions. Every memory region has a remote key
 * which needs to be shared across the network (to access the memory
 * region).
