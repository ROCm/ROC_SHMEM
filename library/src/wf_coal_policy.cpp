/**
 * About the current algorithm:
 *   1) The algorithm is low overhead. It uses no LDS (shared) space or
 *      rounds of a tree reduction (which may cause it to miss some
 *      scenarios).
 *   2) The algorithm can identify multiple groups of coalescable packets
 *      within a wavefront.
 *      As an example:
 *          Threads 0-8 are coalescable.
 *          Threads 10-63 are coalescable.
 *          The logic will generate 3 messages.
 *      +-----------------------+----------+-------------------------+
 *      | Thread_0 ... Thread_8 | Thread_9 | Thread_10 ... Thread_63 |
 *      +-----------------------+----------+-------------------------+
 *      |          msg_1        |  msg 2   |          msg 3          |
 *      +-----------------------+----------+-------------------------+
 *      However, threads must be contiguous by thread id to be coalesced.
 *      For example, Thread_0 and Thread_2 are coalescable, but Thread_1 is
 *      not coalescable (see coalescability conditions) then none of the
 *      three threads can be coalesced.
 *   3) The algorithm misses opportunities when threads have coalescable
 *      messages but the message sizes are different.
